# Step 0 — Setup (Full Step Solution)

Use this after you finish Step 0.

Assessment note: commits are graded. Don’t copy/paste the whole step.

## Complete code snapshot (full files)

See the full end-of-step code here: [snapshots/step-0/](snapshots/step-0/)

## What “done” looks like

- You have starter code locally (cloned or provided).
- You can run the server.
- You can hit the starter endpoint in Postman.
- You created your own GitHub repo and pushed your first commit.

## Commands

Run the server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Test in Postman:

- `GET http://localhost:4000/tours`
- Expect: `200` and `[]` (or a JSON array)

## GitHub repo (minimal)

After confirming it runs:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```
